This is a four-course program that teaches essential computer science concepts for software development ranging from the fundamentals of object-oriented programming to using efficient algorithms to design high-quality software.

This program begins with the basic concepts of Java, and progresses into best practices in modern software development to developing efficient algorithms using sophisticated data structures for complex computational tasks.

Finally, it goes through teaching how to develop interactive and data-driven web apps using JavaScript.
